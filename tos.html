      ⁜ By purchasing a commission, you indicate that you've read and agreed to these Terms of Service.<br><br>

      ⁜ All my price list is in USD.<br><br>

      ⁜ Payment is only through Paypal.<br><br>

      ⁜ Payment comes first.<br><br>

      ⁜ Payments can be split in half, but note that I will start your commission when payment is
      complete.(50%-50%).<br><br>

      ⁜ For each transfer paypal charges me a fee so you will be asked to pay a certain amount to cover it which
      are between (5-12 USD).<br><br>

      ⁜ Be clear with what you want. No problem if your description is long, have your references ready too! (you
      can send me example poses or images to base on).<br><br>

      ⁜ It's not allowed to make money through my art or take credit for it. <br><br>

      ⁜ Don't try to remove my signature from the illustration! In that case I'll keep it in mind the next time
      you want a commission. <br><br>

      ⁜ Once the sketch process is approved, you can't cancel it! (in case you want to change it you will be
      charged an extra fee).<br><br>

      ⁜ You can make up to 3 changes in the sketch process, but big changes mean extra cost, after that changes
      are not accepted. (Unless I forgot something).<br><br>

      ⁜ Be patient! Like you, I am a person and I also have other responsibilities.<br><br>

      ⁜ My native language is not English, so avoid colloquialisms or abbreviations when you are in applying for
      your assignment.<br><br>

      ⁜ You have every right to request Wips from every process.<br><br>

      ⁜ Avoid asking me to copy the exact same pose from another artist.<br><br>

      ⁜ I don't send the drawing software files.<br><br>
